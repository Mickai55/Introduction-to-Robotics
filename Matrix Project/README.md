***FLAPPY BIT***

1) Score <- if you pass a pipe, you increase the score.
2) Progress in difficulty <- speed will increase + decrease space between pipes + space between 2 neighbour pipes
3) More lives <- 3 lives
4) Levels <- when you pass 10 pipes, then the difficulty increases
5) Animations <- score

How to play: Just press the button fast and avoid the pipes!  
Warning: It's hard!
